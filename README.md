Project Description: Arbitrage 
Description: 
1. Given a valid stock ticker, Arbitrage will present the real-time K-graph for any stock
2. Arbitrage will show all put/call option prices at all strike for a certain stock
3. Arbitrage will use stage process (in discrete time finance) to give option price evaluation and look for potential opportunities for arbitrage
4. Arbitrage will utilize a series of statistical & machine learning method (regression, Markov chain, etc) to inference future stock prices
5. Given sufficient time, Arbitrage will also use more ML methods such as LST memory, artificial neural network to make more precise predictions

How to run this: 
1. Enter a valid stock ticker
2. Press "K" to see the real-time K-graph; Press "R" to see the regression. The current stock price and the prediction of the change on stock price (markov chain) is also showed
3. Click on "Next" to see the put/call options of the chosen stock
4. Click on a certain option to see the mathematical pricing from Arbitrage's calculation
5. At any time, click on "Exit" to go back to the previous page.
